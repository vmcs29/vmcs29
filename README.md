## 🧠 How I Approach QA
Strategic and scalable — I build test suites that don’t just catch bugs, they anticipate edge cases. I prioritize reusable logic, dynamic data handling, and robust file validation across environments.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 🛠️ Expanding Playwright and API test coverage
- ⚙️ Modular utilities for error handling and data-driven tests

## 🤝 Team Collaboration
- Driving cross-functional alignment in test strategy
- Fostering continuous improvement in process and tools

## 🧭 My QA Philosophy
_"Precision over perfection. Coverage that inspires confidence, not complacency."_
