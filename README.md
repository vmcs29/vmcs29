## üß† How I Approach QA
Strategic and scalable ‚Äî I build test suites that don‚Äôt just catch bugs, they anticipate edge cases. I prioritize reusable logic, dynamic data handling, and robust file validation across environments.

## üöÄ Current Focus
- üõ†Ô∏è Expanding Playwright and API test coverage
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular utilities for error handling and data-driven tests

## ü§ù Team Collaboration
- Driving cross-functional alignment in test strategy
- Fostering continuous improvement in process and tools

## üß≠ My QA Philosophy
_"Precision over perfection. Coverage that inspires confidence, not complacency."_
